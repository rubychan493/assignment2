		Gymnasia also had teachers of wisdom and philosophy. Community gymnastic events were done as part of the celebrations during various village festivals. In ancient Greece there was a phrase of contempt, "He can neither swim nor write." After a while, however, Olympic athletes began training in buildings specifically designed for them. Community sports never became as popular among ancient Romans as it had among the ancient Greeks. Gyms were used more as a preparation for military service or spectator sports. During the Roman Empire, the gymnastic art was forgotten. In the Dark Ages there were sword fighting tournaments and of chivalry; and after gunpowder was invented sword fighting began to be replaced by the sport of fencing, as well as schools of dagger fighting and wrestling and boxing.
		Being healthy means not only away from diseases but it also means the complete feeling of physical, mental and social well being. Maintaining health and fitness is not a simple task however; not so tough too. We need to involve ourselves into some daily physical activities together with the healthy, fresh and timely food which can only provide us long-term health and fitness benefits. We burn extra and unnecessary calories to our body through physical exercises. Daily physical exercises keep kids so active and put them on a path of better physical and mental health.
		Physical activities along with the proper nutrition are really very beneficial to the people of all ages from any background and abilities. Being involved in the daily physical exercises is a good strategy to defeat obesity. According to the statistics, it is found that around one-third of the U.S. adult citizens are obese and almost 17% of children and adolescents are obese. There are many people suffering from the diabetes and other chronic health problems such as heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer, asthma, overweight, etc.
